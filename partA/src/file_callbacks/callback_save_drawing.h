// Callback specifying what happens when a user chooses
// "File/Save Drawing" from the UI menu 

{
// This menu choice should allow the user to
// save all interactively-performed drawing 
// operations into a file with extension .cmd
// It should pop up a dialog box for choosing 
// the filename where the commands will be saved,
// just like in callback-open-image.h

// The format of this file should be IDENTICAL
// to the format of the file read by the
// ProcessArgs() routine in main.cpp
// 
// Once such a file is saved, it should be possible
// to re-load the file (and thus execute all previously-
// executed drawing commands) by including it as a
// command-line option or by loading it via the menu
//
// In particular, if you perform the following:
//    1. create a file with drawing commands called qq.cmd
//    2. run your program with the option -cmd qq.cmd
//    3. choose 'Save Drawing' from the menu
//    4. save your drawing into a file qq1.cmd
// the files qq.cmd and qq1.cmd should be identical
