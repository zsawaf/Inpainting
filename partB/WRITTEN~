Part B.1 Questions (you must answer questions 1 & 2 to
                    get any credit for Part B.1!!)
------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. Why did the inpainting algorithm work well on your first
    dataset (with Source1, Mask1 as input)?

	Because the background was almost constant in intensity, therefore
	the algorithm didn't have a lot to do in terms of finding best match
	patches. 

 2. Why is your second dataset (Source2, Mask2) a "bad" case for 
    inpaiting? Specifically why do you expect the algorithm to 
    perform poorly on the Source2 image for EVERY setting of the 
    patch radius?

	Because the background was detailed with a lot of different intensities,
	so it would be difficult if not impossible to find another patch to substitute
	for this one.

Part B.2 Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1 (5 points)

The top-level loop of the inpainting algorithm is implemented by
as a while loop in method
inpainting::compute() in file src/inpainting/inpainting_algorithm.cxx

Even though this loop causes the implementation to behave exactly
"as advertised" in the paper for most cases of source images and 
initial masks, there are situations where this is *not* the case. 
In such cases, the implementation is expected to generate inpainted
images that have significant artifacts. 

You need to identify what the problem is with this particular loop.

[Hint: To answer this question, you do *not* need to look at the code 
       of the inpaint_region() and find_first_unfilled_pixel() methods 
       or of the vil_trace_8con_boundary() function (although you do need
       to understand what these methods do). Also, the answer
       has nothing to do with variables iterations_done, max_iterations,
       and inpainted_new_region]

Question 2 (15 points)

Prove that if gamma(t) = ( x(t), y(t) ) is a 2D curve, the curvature
k(t) at point gamma(t) is given by the expression

                 2     2     
           dx   d y   d x   dy
           -- * --- - --- * --
                  2     2
           dt   dt    dt    dt
   k(t) = -------------------------
           -                 -  3/2
          |   dx  2    dy  2  |
          | ( -- ) + ( -- )   |
          |   dt       dt     |
           -                 -

(This question is identical to the one on Slide 13 of Lecture 10)
